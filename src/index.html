    <h1 class="title pt-4">Obadiah 1</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle pt-2">Edom’s Fall</h2>

    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">This is the vision of Obadiah. This is what the Almighty Lord says about Edom:</p>

    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">We have heard a message from the Lord. A messenger was sent among the nations to say, “Get ready! Let’s go to war
      against Edom.”</p>

    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">“Edom, I will make you the smallest of nations. Others will despise you.</p>
    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">Your arrogance has deceived you. You live on rocky cliffs. You make your home up high. You say to yourself, ‘No
      one can bring me down to earth.’</p>
    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">Even though you fly high like an eagle and build your nest among the stars, I will bring you down from there,”
      declares the Lord.</p>

    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">The day of the Lord is near for all nations. Edom, you will be treated as you have treated others. You will get
      back what you have given.</p>
    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">As you, Israel, drank on my holy mountain, so all nations will drink in turn. They will drink and guzzle down
      everything in it. They will be like those who have never existed.</p>

    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">But refugees will live on Mount Zion. It will be holy. The descendants of Jacob will get back their possessions.
    </p>

    <p class="is-small is-text mt-3">Those who are victorious will come from Mount Zion to rule Esau’s mountain. The kingdom will belong to the Lord.
